# How I Cut P95 Latency by ~25% Across Microservices

**Stack:** Java, Spring Boot, AWS RDS, Redis, Grafana

**TL;DR:** Indexed hot queries, added request caching, trimmed payloads, and introduced async processing for heavy paths.

## Steps
1. Instrumented with Micrometer + Grafana to find hot spots.
2. Added DB indexes & analyzed slow queries.
3. Caching layer on idempotent reads.
4. Split heavy synchronous flow into async job.

**Result:** ~25% improvement in P95 latency and fewer timeouts during traffic spikes.
